## Research Interests

My goal is to study how quantum computers can help solve the electronic structure problem. High accuracy chemical computations of molecular ground states will enable us to design better drugs, build better superconductors and reduce energy consumption of Born Haber processes (among many other industrial applications). To this end, I hope to improve techniques that can mitigate errors on Noisy Intermediate-Scale (noisy near term) Quantum devices.  

Aside from my current research in quantum noise, I am also interested in quantum simulation, superconducting qubits and topological qubits, all of which I hope to study really really soon!
