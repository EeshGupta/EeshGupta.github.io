# Hello!
I'm pursuing graduate studies in experimental physics. When applying to grad school and scholarships, I have always found it helpful to read essays of previous applicants. As such, here are my essays. Hope this helps!
1. [Graduate School: Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f22Yd3B2gxK9u2igsQyPrEED7bWtANpY/view?usp=share_link)
2. [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program: Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-M8py2Zl9tDuxa6fkzl7nRPj5BUkmEMA/view?usp=share_link)
3. [Goldwater Scholarship: Research Essay](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqcmOEezC4grq1mkVUx6H1zHINiGnmX2/view?usp=share_link)
