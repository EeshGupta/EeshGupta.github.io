## Research Interests

Quantum computers employ intrinsic properties of quantum mechanics to solve problems deemed intractable by our current classical computers. However, near term quantum devices have limited resources due to hardware constraints. My goal as a physicist is twofold: to accelerate the development of quantum computers as well as to create algorithms that maximize the potential of near term devices.

## Currently

## AMAZING People I've come across 
_as of October, 2021_
* **Diane Frey**: Invested in bettering herself as well as her students, Ms. Frey teaches AP English Language and Composition at Edison High School, NJ.
* **Cal Newport**: His [ideas](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/) on student life and workplace productivity are transformational. Cal is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University. 
* **Stephen Schnetzer**: Providing me with ample resources and opportunities to grow as a researcher, I am indebted to him. Professor Schnetzer is a Professor of Physics at Rutgers University.  
* **Noah Palladino**: A physicist in training who taught me a lot about giving back, Noah is pursuing a PhD in experimental physics at MIT. 
* **Alexandre Blais and Zlatko Minev**: Although I haven't met them, their talks on superconducting qubits [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5nxusm_Umk&t=1872s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJjQGu85Ps) have inspired me to explore this field. Alexandre is a Professor of Physics at Universit√© de Sherbrooke and Zlatko is a scientist at IBM Quantum, TJ Watson. 
* **Sunil Somalwar**: Teaching me a lot about making sense of quantum mechanics and doing physics on the fly, Professor Somalwar is a Professor of Physics at Rutgers University. 
* **Ruslan Shaydulin**: The clarity of his talks and the depth of his knowledge on quantum algorithms is brilliant. Ruslan is a  Maria Goeppert Mayer fellow at Argonne National Laboratory. 
* **Carol Lin and Kevin Brown**: Their efforts in organizing activities and socials made my summer 2021 virtual internship feel in-person. Carol is a Student Coordinator Intern at Argonne National Labratory and Kevin is a Postdoctoral Appointee at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility.
* **Alexey Galda**: I've learned a lot from his methodical approach to research. Alexey is a Principal Scientist at Menten AI.
* **David Vanderbilt**: Focused on imparting his great intuitive powers on quantum mechanics to his students, Professor Vanderbilt is a Board of Governors Professor of Physics at Rutgers University.
* **Eric Allender**: His lecturing powers on complexity theory are just on another level. Professor Allender is a Distinguished Profesor of Computer Science at Rutgers University.
* **Andrew Wan**: Eager to learn and make original contributions, Andrew is a senior at Montgomery High School, NJ.

_I am sure I have missed a lot of people!_
