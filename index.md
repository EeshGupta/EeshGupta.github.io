# Hello!
I'm an undergraduate physics major at Rutgers University. My professional profile is linked [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eeshgupta/). This webpage contains my scholarship/internship essays and a few related tips. For more detailed posts on academia and Physics, please visit [Mallory Ladd](http://www.malloryladd.com/) and [Alex Lang](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/home).


## Resources
When applying to summer research programs and scholarships, I have always found it useful to read applications of previous applicants regardless of whether they were successful or not. So here are my application materials for programs I have applied to over the past few years. Hope this helps!

1. **Quantum Computing Internship IBM & Princeton** (QURIP):In 2021, my application to the QURIP program was accepted. The main components were the [statement of purpose](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/Statement_of_Purpose_QURIP.pdf) and obtaining the IBM Qiskit Advocate Badge. The latter requires somewhat knowledge of Qiskit and code contributions to IBM's quantum computing community. To contribute code, check out issues on Qiskit Terra github with the label "good first issue".
2. **Barry Goldwater Scholarship**: In 2022, I recieved the Goldwater Scholarship. The main components were the [research essay](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/2022_Research_Essay_Goldwater.pdf), the [short answer questions](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/Short_Answer_Questions_Goldwater.pdf) and the [research statements](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/Research_Statements_Goldwater.pdf). Please apply even if you don't have publications! I found reading application materials of Goldwater Scholars Brandon Barker and Nishanth Kumar really helpful (both freely available on the web). 

3. **General** Check out Claire McKay Bowen's excellent [webapp](https://clairemckaybowen.com/fellowship) which goes into nuts and bolts of crafting paragraphs for grants/fellowships. 

If you are applying to these programs and have questions/want some essay to be looked over, don't hesitate to reach out to my personal email -- eag4013@gmail.com -- and I will try my best to get back to you.
