# Hello!
I'm an undergraduate physics major at Rutgers University. My professional profile is linked [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eeshgupta/). This webpage contains my scholarship/internship essays and a few related tips.

## Resources
When applying to summer research programs and scholarships, I have always found it useful to read applications of previous applicants regardless of whether they were successful or not. So here are my application materials for programs I have applied to over the past few years. Hope this helps!

1. **Quantum Computing Internship IBM & Princeton** (QURIP):In 2021, my application to the QURIP program was accepted. The main components were the [statement of purpose](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/Statement_of_Purpose_QURIP.pdf) and obtaining the IBM Qiskit Advocate Badge. The latter requires somewhat knowledge of Qiskit and code contributions to IBM's quantum computing community. To contribute code, check out issues on Qiskit Terra github with the label "good first issue".
2. **Barry Goldwater Scholarship**: In 2022, I recieved the Goldwater Scholarship. The main components were the [research essay](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/2022_Research_Essay_Goldwater.pdf), the [short answer questions](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/Short_Answer_Questions_Goldwater.pdf) and the [research statements](https://github.com/EeshGupta/eeshgupta.github.io/blob/main/documents/Research_Statements_Goldwater.pdf). Please apply even if you don't have publications! I found reading application materials of Goldwater Scholars Brandon Barker and Nishanth Kumar really helpful (both freely available on the web). 

3. **General** Check out Claire McKay Bowen's excellent [webapp](https://clairemckaybowen.com/fellowship) which goes into nuts and bolts of crafting paragraphs for grants/fellowships. 

If you are applying to these programs and have questions/want some essay to be looked over, don't hesitate to reach out to my personal email -- eag4013@gmail.com -- and I will try my best to get back to you.

### Thoughts on the NSF GRFP

Having submitted the application this past week, I feel relieved. It was a 5 month exercise – starting from a severe inferiority complex and ending with a slight regret of not expressing myself clearly enough.( A full circle of life…and it moves us all  haha) Here are the lessons I learned: 

**You are what you are**
As I read application materials of dozens of students, each one setting a bar higher than the last, I was amazed to find that people could pack in so many publications and impactful outreach activities in a space of 3 years of college. Their achievements also initially eroded my confidence in my own chances. Can I seriously compete with such a talented bunch?
Over the summer, I got to work! Aiming for 2 publications by end of summer, a pretentious interview series with alumni physics students and several completed scholarship applications, I overextended myself. None of these goals were accomplished. They were insane to start with. What I did instead was deepen my existing commitments in research and the outreach work I was already doing with a Professor. In other words, the goal of broadening my skills was replaced by another –deepening them.

**Serving Your Truth**
Since a person can’t transform oneself to be the perfect candidate, he or she can try another approach that is worth their time: doing service to their own truth. Being clear about your own experiences is hard because our constantly busy life doesn’t allow a lot of time for self-reflection. For example, one of my projects kept dragging on past a year since my initial appointment. I wasn’t working on it anymore. The ball was being played on someone else’s court. It took a lot of communication between us to finally submit the research paper to the journal. As I was completing my NSF fellowship, I viewed such delay as a weakness, as something to be ignored. In doing so, I failed to capitalize on a great story which would have shown that I am prepared for the rigors of research. Such delays on projects are, in fact, more common than I thought. If I had mentioned that challenge and how I worked together with colleagues to address it, my app could be stronger. This example shows that there is more to your experiences than you think!

**Not fearing the application**
NSF GRFP is intimidating. Its hype as the  “gold standard” of fellowships made me even more afraid of failing to win it. This created a bit of stress and paranoia that I failed to enjoy at certain points. I don’t want that attitude. Because the way we do things really affects how we do other things. A better approach to the application is to view it as a science-writing version of a Hobbit adventure than a fatal writing adventure to the volcanoes of Mordor. Regardless, I grew a lot from this experience and I will use all the learned bits in my personal statements for grad school up next!

A GRFP writing guide is in the works (at least planned)! I’ve read tons of advice over the web which was useful at different stages. I will try to compile it to a single, nicely organized google doc. Until then, Happy Diwali!
