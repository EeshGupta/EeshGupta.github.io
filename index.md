# Hello!
I'm pursuing graduate studies in experimental physics. When applying to grad school and scholarships, I have always found it helpful to read essays of previous applicants. As such, here are my essays. Hope this helps!
1. [Graduate School: Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f22Yd3B2gxK9u2igsQyPrEED7bWtANpY/view?usp=share_link)
2. [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program: Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-M8py2Zl9tDuxa6fkzl7nRPj5BUkmEMA/view?usp=share_link)
3. [Goldwater Scholarship: Research Essay](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqcmOEezC4grq1mkVUx6H1zHINiGnmX2/view?usp=share_link)

_If I can be of any help, reach out to me at eesh.gupta.pro@gmail.com !_
<!-- I'm an undergraduate physics major at Rutgers University. My research goal is to help develop fault tolerant quantum computers which can outperform modern supercomputers in simulation of many body phenomena. To this end, I am specifically interested in  improving both the design and the control of superconducting quantum systems. My professional profile is linked [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eeshgupta/).
