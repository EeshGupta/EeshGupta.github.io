# Hello!
I'm an undergraduate physics major at Rutgers University. My research goal is to help develop fault tolerant quantum computers which can outperform modern supercomputers in simulation of many body phenomena. To this end, I am specifically interested in  improving both the design and the control of superconducting quantum systems. My professional profile is linked [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eeshgupta/).
