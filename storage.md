Given my demanding role as a physics and computer science student, I try as much as possible to dedicate the time left over to research and my flute. So I apologize in advance for delays in response. Thanks!

### Thoughts on the NSF GRFP

Having submitted the application this past week, I feel relieved. It was a 5 month exercise – starting from a severe inferiority complex and ending with a slight regret of not expressing myself clearly enough.( A full circle of life…and it moves us all  haha) Here are the lessons I learned: 

**You are what you are**

As I read application materials of dozens of students, each one setting a bar higher than the last, I was amazed to find that people could pack in so many publications and impactful outreach activities in a space of 3 years of college. Their achievements also initially eroded my confidence in my own chances. Can I seriously compete with such a talented bunch?
Over the summer, I got to work! Aiming for 2 publications by end of summer, a pretentious interview series with alumni physics students and several completed scholarship applications, I overextended myself. None of these goals were accomplished. They were insane to start with. What I did instead was deepen my existing commitments in research and the outreach work I was already doing with a Professor. In other words, the goal of broadening my skills was replaced by another –deepening them.

**Serving Your Truth**

Since a person can’t transform oneself to be the perfect candidate, he or she can try another approach that is worth their time: doing service to their own truth. Being clear about your own experiences is hard because our constantly busy life doesn’t allow a lot of time for self-reflection. For example, one of my projects kept dragging on past a year since my initial appointment. I wasn’t working on it anymore. The ball was being played on someone else’s court. It took a lot of communication between us to finally submit the research paper to the journal. As I was completing my NSF fellowship, I viewed such delay as a weakness, as something to be ignored. In doing so, I failed to capitalize on a great story which would have shown that I am prepared for the rigors of research. Such delays on projects are, in fact, more common than I thought. If I had mentioned that challenge and how I worked together with colleagues to address it, my app could be stronger. This example shows that there is more to your experiences than you think!

**Not fearing the application**

NSF GRFP is intimidating. Its hype as the  “gold standard” of fellowships made me even more afraid of failing to win it. This created a bit of stress and paranoia that I failed to enjoy at certain points. I don’t want that attitude. Because the way we do things really affects how we do other things. A better approach to the application is to view it as a science-writing version of a Hobbit adventure than a fatal writing adventure to the volcanoes of Mordor. Regardless, I grew a lot from this experience and I will use all the learned bits in my personal statements for grad school up next!

A GRFP writing guide is in the works (at least planned)! I’ve read tons of advice over the web which was useful at different stages. I will try to compile it to a single, nicely organized google doc. Until then, Happy Diwali!
